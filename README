Project :Snake-AI

Included Files :
    *main.py
    *ai_game.py
    *game.py
    *README

Running Instructions :
    1.To Run the file
    	*Run the command "python3 main.py" in the files directory.

    2.Select one of the 3 options (as mentioned below) presented in the game's main menu screen.
    	*Single Player 
    	*AI
    	*Quit

    3.The 3 options lead to 3 different outputs ,as follows :

    	*Single Player:	Opens a screen running the traditional game of snake and food,
    					where the player is able to control the movement of the snake
    					using WASD keys i.e. UP,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT respectively.

    	*AI: Opens a screen where the snake moves by itself to achieve the game's
			 goal of eating the food.This AI uses the shortest path possible to 
			 reach the food		

		*Quit : Exits the game ,closes the window.

Notes and Assumptions :
	
	There are 3 python files used in this project :

		main.py: This is the file to be run using python , contains the mainloop and runs the other files. Also creates the root tkinter class

			*callback functions : These functions contain the calls to the 3 options in the menu, they are called when
								 the respective button is pressed.

			*main function : Creates a frame to display the buttons connected to the 3 options.

		Common functions :

			*Initializing functions : First initializes the class itself, continues to declare variables required to start the game,
									 Creates the display canvas which contains all the necessary elements of the game.
									 Call functions necessary to continue the gameplay.

			*generate_food : When initially called, randomly creates a green food block on the canvas(but not on the snake).
							 When the food is eaten , this function is called again and again.

			*check_food_collision : When called ,it runs compares the positions of the snake parts and the food , and returns TRUE or FALSE.

			*init_directions : Binds the WASD and Esc buttons to the respective commands.

			*turn (up,down,right,left) : When called by the respective binded button , this function turns the snake up,down,right,left wiht necessary conditions.

			*create_snake : Creates the snake head and 3 snake parts for a start using canvas module.

			*move_snake : Obtains the current position of the snake and the change of the head snake coordinates , then moves the head to this position and 
						  in turn shifts all parts of the snake ,imitating the movement of the snake.
						  If the food is eaten in this movement ,then the food is removed and randomly created again.

			*check death : compares the position head of the snake to the outer region of the canvas and the positions of the snake parts.
						   return TRUE or FALSE.

			*exit_game : exits the game and closes the window.

			*run_game : calls the constant move function and mainloop function.


		game.py : This file contains the human_Game class created to run the traditional game of snake and food.

			*constant_move : Using after function from the canvas module , this function is called continuously with time delay.
							 Increments the temporary position in the direction of the snake.

		ai_game : This file contains the ai_Game class created to run the game using an AI (shortest distance algorithm) of snake and food.

			*shortest_path : Calculates the shortest path for the x and y axes.

			*move_vertically :
