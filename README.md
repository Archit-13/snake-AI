# snake-AI

I think this will hopefully be our 274 project. Currently working on creating the background, which is already done.

Will be done via tkinter mainly based on the repo below. I've tried to not copy anything, instead just using the ideas of how the game was created, etc. So far, I think the game mechanics could be fundamentally different based on the classes we will create.

Will start by botch coding the initial positions of the snake and the "apple" right now, then try to create unit tests based on how much time I will have.

Depending on how quickly we'll finish creating the actual game mechanics, the project could pivot to a different kind of snake game. We could create a 2-player snake game, with the bigger snake eating the smaller snake.

One of the harder tasks will be getting the computer to control the snake (probably?)

The main focus will be to train the computer to play python using either a Greedy/Hamilton algorithm depending on the time we will put into it, once we get all the aforementioned steps done, we will write our own greedy algorithm for that.
